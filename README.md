### Hello

Hi, my name is Jason Milldrum and my amateur radio callsign is NT7S. I'm the owner of [Etherkit](https://www.etherkit.com), my business which sells open source electronics and amateur radio products. I open source the hardware, firmware, and software of every product that I develop for sale (and others which I don't sell and only post here for others to use).

If you enjoy my released work, take advantage of it, or just like what I'm doing in general, you can help me by subscribing to my [SubscribeStar](https://www.subscribestar.com/nt7s) account. At this point, Etherkit makes enough to keep itself afloat and occasionally funds a new bit of lab gear, but that's about it. Purchasing my products through Etherkit or giving further assistance via SubscribeStar helps me to fund the development of new open source products and software/firmware libraries. I believe in [Elmering](https://www.onallbands.com/word-of-the-day-elmer-why-do-we-call-a-ham-radio-mentor-elmer/) and giving back to the community when I can, and I definitely plan to do more in this area in the future.

As of September 2020, here's what I'm working on and what is coming soon:
- I'm completing my [Empyrean](https://www.etherkit.com/microcontrollers/empyrean.html) campaign on Indiegogo and will be moving it to regular production soon.
- Next up I will be finishing work on my amateur radio MEPT (Manned Experimental Propagation Transmitter) named [OpenBeacon 2](https://github.com/etherkit/OpenBeacon2).
- Smaller projects that are mostly completed, such as a Si5351B/Si5351C breakout board, QRP antenna trap board, and some various boards useful for the workbench.
- I definitely want to get back to the development of a QRP transceiver for amateur radio use, much like I almost did with my CC1 project.
- I'm also interested in make some easy kits for kids to make, as I have a couple of them in my own home!
- Would like to put some more work into the Test and Measurement document that I'm collaborating on with LA3PNA.
- How to help get new folks interested in ham radio homebrewing is something I'm also mulling over.
